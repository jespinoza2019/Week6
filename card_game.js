//Card Game War between two players
/*Instructions - For the final project you will be creating an 
automated version of the classic card game WAR! 
There are many versions of the game WAR. 
In this version there are only 2 players.
-You do not need to do anything special when there is a 
tie in a round.
Think about how you would build this project and write 
your plan down. 
Consider classes such as: Card, Deck, Player, as well as what 
properties and methods they may include. 
    You do not need to accept any user input, 
    when you run your code, the entire game should play out 
    instantly without any user input inside of your browserâ€™s 
    console.(no prompts needed)
The completed project should, when executed, do the following:
Deal 26 Cards to each Player from a Deck of 52 cards.
Iterate through the turns where each Player plays a Card.
The Player who played the higher card is awarded a point
Ties result in zero points for both Players
After all cards have been played, display the score and 
declare the winner.
Write a Unit Test using Mocha and Chai for at least one of 
the functions you write.*/


//War Game
    

/*The game calls for a deck of cards with 52 cards. The deck will be cards from an array.
although the deck will have fours suits, cards will have a face (what the card looks like) 
and a value associated with the face. Starting with 52 cards with values from  2 to 14. 
Ace is 14, king is 13, queen = 12, jack = 11 then face value for the rest. The suit won't matter 
in this game but the value of each card will. There will be no Jokers in this game*/

such as a number or jack, queen . . . ect. There will be four suits and each face will have 
a value*/
